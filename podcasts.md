I&#8217;ve been on a number of podcasts since I started in 2005, here&#8217;s a list. I&#8217;ll try to get copies of these old shows available for listening.

### Active Shows (as a Host or Guest)

  * The New Closet Geek Show (you&#8217;re sitting in it, find new episodes [here](http://closetgeekshow.ca/category/podcast/))
  * [Gapage: Conversations with Ken and Brent](https://gapages.blogspot.ca/) &#8211; a conversational podcast, Ken and I try to figure out how we&#8217;re such good friends despite being seperated by a generation. Co-hosted with [ScarboroughDude](http://dicksnjanes.blogspot.com) it&#8217;s released infrequently but isn&#8217;t technically podfaded.
  * [The Anger Core](http://theangercore.com) &#8211; a entirely unique idea, we cover the stories in the news that piss us off. Co-hosted with [Jasen Buch](http://aliencg.com) and [Jason Reese](http://upinthisbrain.com/).
  * [The Showhole](http://theshowhole.com) &#8211; Three podcasters. One podcast. Zero notes. Co-hosted by [Jasen Buch](http://aliencg.com) and [Jason Reese](http://upinthisbrain.com/).

### Podfaded Shows

  * The Old Closet Geek Show (the old one ran from 2005 to about 2010, I still need to get these back online, some are still available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Brent+Morris%22))
  * Relentless Wave (Short lived and I don&#8217;t think I have any copies anywhere, it was a &#8220;song a day&#8221; podcast focused on songs that work well in the game [Audiosurf](http://store.steampowered.com/app/12900))
  * Old Gapage (we lost almost all of our shows due to a hard drive crash, some are still available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=gapage))
  * Colours out of Space (a DJ mix podcast focused on trying to combine music from several different genres into a cohesive sound, still available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22TCG+Sterling%22&sort=-date))
