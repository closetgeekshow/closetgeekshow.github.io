Sometimes a show ends, but more commonly it fades away from disuse. Over the years I&#8217;ve had that happen to many shows. 

### My Podfaded Shows

  * The Old Closet Geek Show (the old one ran from 2005 to about 2010, I still need to get these back online, some are still available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Brent+Morris%22))
  * Relentless Wave (Short lived and I don&#8217;t think I have any copies anywhere, it was a &#8220;song a day&#8221; podcast focused on songs that work well in the game [Audiosurf](http://store.steampowered.com/app/12900))
  * Old Gapage (we lost almost all of our shows due to a hard drive crash, some are still available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=gapage))
  * Colours out of Space (a DJ mix podcast focused on trying to combine music from several different genres into a cohesive sound, still available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22TCG+Sterling%22&sort=-date))
  * Brent Outta Shape (short lived, still available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Brent%20Morris%22%20outta))
  * [Pop Culture Intelligensia](http://popcultureintelligentsia.com/search/podcast) &#8211; a live group radio style show covering interesting pop culture topics with interviews and discussion.
