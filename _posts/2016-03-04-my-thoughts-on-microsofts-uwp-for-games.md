So I saw this on Friday: [Microsoft wants to monopolise games development on PC](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war)

> &#8220;With its new Universal Windows Platform (UWP) initiative, Microsoft has built a closed platform-within-a-platform into Windows 10, as the first apparent step towards locking down the consumer PC ecosystem and monopolising app distribution and commerce&#8221;

I&#8217;m a PC guy and have defended Microsoft at every turn, but if this is true, they&#8217;ve lost me &#8211; glad I haven&#8217;t upgraded to Windows 10 now. Can UWP games show up on [itch.io](http://itch.io) or [GameJolt](http://gamejolt.com/) (two great places to find indie games made by small teams) or do we have the use the garbage that is the Windows Store? I haven&#8217;t loaded that shit up in a year, it runs like a dog. 

> &#8220;If UWP is to gain the support of major PC game and application developers, it must be as open a platform as today&#8217;s predominant win32 API, which is used by all major PC games and applications.&#8221;

Microsoft needs to understand that they only hold the dominant position they do _specifically_ because they had an open platform that other developers could leverage to build their own apps. In the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve waffled back and forth on whether it&#8217;s good or not that Microsoft has been trying to make things like Surface more locked down. I thought it was the only way to pull in the sort of people that don&#8217;t want to or care to understand how to work a computer. I&#8217;ve now figured out that it&#8217;s a bad thing.

[Microsoft has since responded](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/gears-of-war-developer-epic-games-tim-sweeney-games-industry-fight-microsoft), but I don&#8217;t know if I believe them.

> &#8220;The Universal Windows Platform is a fully open ecosystem, available to every developer, that can be supported by any store. We continue to make improvements for developers; for example, in the Windows 10 November Update, we enabled people to easily side-load apps by default, with no UX required.&#8221;

As a side note, I cannot believe I&#8217;m in agreement with Epic on anything &#8211; I&#8217;m still mad they haven&#8217;t made a Jazz Jackrabbit game in 18 years (we will not speak of the 2002 game boy abomination).
