  <div>
  <div><blockquote><p>"Instead of raiding dispensaries &ndash; of which there are at least 100 in Toronto alone &ndash; and prosecuting the poor schmoes who work there (remember, one of the main purposes of legalization is to end pointless criminalization), government should be working to regulate these stores. They should also be learning from them, because they offer decent customer service and employ some impressive pot sommeliers. Under the current plan, dispensaries' customers are more likely to return to the black market than shop at granny's state-run Pot Store."</p></blockquote></div></div>
