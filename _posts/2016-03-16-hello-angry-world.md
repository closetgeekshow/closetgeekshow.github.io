These were theÂ words that ignited the dream that propelled us toward creating a podcast fueled by anger, sometimes fake and sometimes as real as the screen you are reading these words on.

Join [@AlienCG](https://twitter.com/AlienCG?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss), [@closetgeekshow](https://twitter.com/closetgeekshow?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss) and [@upinthisbrain](https://twitter.com/upinthisbrain?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss) as they slide on the pants of controversy and take on the newsworthy and maybe not so newsworthy in an audio free-for-all that will make other podcasts seem just a tad less podcasty in comparison.
