      &#8220;When “poaching” is used to describe one company offering an employee of another company a better job here’s the subtext I hear:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        An employee doesn’t have the right to find the best job for themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        The employee is the property of the company.
      </li>
      <li>
        The employee is as good as a dead animal if it leaves.&#8221;
