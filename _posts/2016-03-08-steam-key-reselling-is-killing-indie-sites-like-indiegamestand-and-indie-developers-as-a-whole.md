    &#8220;You get a bunch of stolen credit card numbers and then go to a legit Steam key reseller site and use the stolen info to buy the digital codes.  You grab as many codes as you can and then go over to one of these gray market resellers and turn your keys into real money since you bought them with stolen cards.  Meanwhile, the website and/or developer that you purchased the key from gets a credit card chargeback or other dispute 30-60 days later.&#8221;
