    Great idea. Varies the appearance of the player base, originally everyone was a white bald guy. Most of the time that&#8217;s how I play a game with custom characters anyway. Hit randomize until I like it and move on.

    If you don&#8217;t like how the game works go play one of the 100 other survival games like it. &#8220;assigning a permanent gender resembled transphobia&#8221;, are you for real? What about all the games where you don&#8217;t even play as a human?
