  <div><p>Saw this on the menu screen for Titanfall 2 and it might be the best edited gameplay montage&nbsp;I've ever seen. First of all every move is crazy skillful, then the action in it syncs up perfectly to the music (Knife Party &amp; Tom Morello - Battle Sirens (RIOT Remix) - love that track), that bit at around 0:53 is wonderful - I'm pretty sure I yelled out "oh shit!" on my couch.&nbsp;</p></div></div>

      Saw this on the menu screen for Titanfall 2 and it might be the best edited gameplay montage I&#8217;ve ever seen. First of all every move is crazy skillful, then the action in it syncs up perfectly to the music (Knife Party & Tom Morello &#8211; Battle Sirens (RIOT Remix) &#8211; love that track), that bit at around 0:53 is wonderful &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty sure I yelled out &#8220;oh shit!&#8221; on my couch.
