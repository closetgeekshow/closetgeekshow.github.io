      &#8220;Younger Eastern European players, those under 30 years old, don&#8217;t have the same reaction. Diaconescu says they see Black the Fall as just a dystopian sci-fi game, rather than a reflection of their region&#8217;s recent past. Perhaps that&#8217;s the most inadvertently chilling thing about the game â€” how quickly the world moves on, and how soon we forget.&#8221;
