    &#8220;the law says that if Megacorp spots offending content, YouTube is obligated to remove it. The DMCA doesn&#8217;t say that YouTube is obligated to find that content themselves and tell Megacorp about it. YouTube is effectively snitching on its own users.

    Then today a friend got a notice today saying his ad rev for a particular episode is now being given to a music label. Why? He was doing a Let&#8217;s Play of a game that had some music in it, that music label claims they own the license. But they don&#8217;t becaUse it&#8217;s in the GAME THAT PAID TO LICENSE IT ALREADY.
