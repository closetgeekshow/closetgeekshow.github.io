  <blockquote><p>As someone who hated math in college, I&rsquo;m here to help you use some mathematical functions and to think about them in non-math ways. Think of them more as magic cheat sheets. I&rsquo;ll be taking some liberties with my language to make this more accessible, so if you&rsquo;re a math whiz please be gentle. I&rsquo;ll stick to generic fantasy for a lot of these examples even though Spiff Spacely Saves The Universe is sci-fi, but keep in mind you could use it for increasing enemy difficulty, armor improvements, weapon damage, when to learn spells or abilities, or all sorts of things that could apply to multiple genres. Try to think of examples for your game!</p></blockquote><p>Where has this article been all my gamedev life?</p></div>
