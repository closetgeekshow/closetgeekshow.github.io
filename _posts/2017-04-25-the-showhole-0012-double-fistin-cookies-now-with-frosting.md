    The holenotes took a ton of time. So did editing this podcast. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve decided to do both differently. How? First, instead of going through the episode minute by minute and taking meticulous notes for the holenotes, I am going to write whatever I want for each episode. Maybe it will sort of make sense, like this week. Maybe I will write about my favorite brand of toilet paper. Who knows.

Basically, whatever I have an idea to throw in there is what you&#8217;re going to get. Also, the embarassing stuff I normally edit out stays in! The burps, farts, inappropriate personal insults and borderline gross XXX comments &#8211; you get it all unless it was so truly horrible that I wrote down on my index card that it absolutely, positively has to go!

    What does all of this mean for you, the listener? You&#8217;ll get the episode a lot faster. That&#8217;s great, right? Sure, it will be a bit sloppier and a lot less polished. So what?
