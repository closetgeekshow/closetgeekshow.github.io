  Currently infuriated at this $500 podcasting course I saw. The syllabus is pathetic and teaches you nothing more than a weekend at a Podcamp would. <a href="https://closetgeekshow.withknown.com/tag/MMPR" class="p-category" rel="tag">#MMPR</a> cannot come fast enough. I think social media gurus expel some sort of film that just stays on your skin, I feel gross. $500!?!
