    &#8220;When a player adopted democracy in Civilization, their aggression would be automatically reduced by 2. Code being code, if Gandhi went democratic his aggression wouldnâ€™t go to -1, it looped back around to the ludicrously high figure of 255, making him as aggressive as a civilization could possibly be.&#8221;

    I must have missed this when it was originally published in 2003 &#8211; this was for Civ 1 but they&#8217;ve kept Ghandi&#8217;s erratic behaviour in subsequent games.
