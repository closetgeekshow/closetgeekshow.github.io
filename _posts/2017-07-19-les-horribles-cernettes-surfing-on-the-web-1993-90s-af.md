      This band has a number of firsts attached to it. It was the first band and the first song on the web, a photo of them was also the first photo on the web. They performed together from 1990 to 2012 (with a one time reunion concert on July 15, 2017).

      Also interesting (to me, at least) and the first iteration of this video was made in VRML, you could fly through it in 3d space &#8211; in 1996.
