      Goodnight little yellow guy. This was my primary chat program in high school, it felt like everyone at Appleby had an AIM handle (I do not remember my handle, I&#8217;m sure it was stupid and embarrassing). The app had some great features and was even interoperable with 3rd party clients for awhile.
