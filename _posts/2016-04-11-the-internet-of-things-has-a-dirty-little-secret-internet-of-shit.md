  <p>
    &#8220;The problem with the Internet of Things is that the hardware is only one aspect. The makers need to keep servers running to support them, keep APIs up to date, keep security up to date and, well, pay employees.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To me that&#8217;s not even the most important problem, the problem that often these devices REQUIRE a connection and in the case of an emergency, technical glitch, forgot to pay the &#8216;net bill problem &#8211; it suddenly becomes less functional than the dumb device you had to start with.
