  <div>
  <p>"What if the dominant discourse on poverty is just wrong? What if the problem isn&rsquo;t that poor people have bad morals &ndash; that they&rsquo;re lazy and impulsive and irresponsible and have no family values &ndash; or that they lack the skills and smarts to fit in with our shiny 21st-century economy? What if the problem is that poverty is profitable?"</p><p>Wait a second, are you saying that people don't already understand that's what it is about? Well that's terrifying.&nbsp;</p></div>
