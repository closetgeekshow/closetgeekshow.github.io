      Check out this joyless misanthrope! 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Also this little snippet sort of undercuts most of her argument:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Of course I understand that a lot of children are deeply attached to their stuffies — I still have my favourite teddy bear, Holly, and I’m almost 30 years old&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      Also also, does everyone call them stuffies? Because growing up there were always just stuffed animals in our family.

    <p>
      Also also also, who still has their childhood toy? I still got my Fisher Price Bunny kicking around somewhere&#8230;
