  </p><p>Today on Pop Culture Intelligentsia we&rsquo;ll talk with producer, engineer and mixer, <a href="http://www.markpistel.com/">Mark Pistel</a> about protest music. Is it relevant? Does it change anything? Mark was a founding member of the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_(band)">Consolidated</a>, who had radical activist leanings. We&rsquo;ll also talk with <a href="http://www.shardcore.org/">Eric Drass</a>, who is an artist who paints, creates digital installation, and generative experiments that live on the net. In particular, we&rsquo;re going to talk about his latest foray, <a href="http://glitchnn.tumblr.com/">The Glitch News Network</a>, a bot that scrapes various online news sources for images of the latest stories and glitches and mashes them into a 2 second video. In our third and last segment we&rsquo;ll discuss <a href="https://storium.com/">Storium</a>, an online storytelling game. Storium is based around creative writing. As you play, the game helps you figure out what to write next and how to keep your story interesting. We&rsquo;ll be joined by Storium&rsquo;s CEO and co-founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/stlhood">Stephen Hood</a>.</p>
