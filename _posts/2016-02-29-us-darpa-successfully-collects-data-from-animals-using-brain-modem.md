  <p>
    &#8220;The tiny, implanted chip, developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), uses a tiny sensor that travels through blood vessels, lodges in the brain and records neural activity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Neurologists injected tiny sensors into livestocks’ veins and then recorded the electrical impulses that control the animals’ movements for six months.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>THAT&#8217;S NOT THE LEAST BIT TERRIFYING</strong>
