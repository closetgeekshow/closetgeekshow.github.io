  <div><p>I've been amped for the new Chase &amp; Status album release. Each of their albums have been so stylistically varied and well produced that they've never been deleted from my offline libraries. Was hoping that would happen again with 'Tribe' and based on the fact I've listened to the whole thing like 5 times since it came out I think they did it again. Solid album.&nbsp;</p></div></div>

      I&#8217;ve been amped for the new Chase & Status album release. Each of their albums have been so stylistically varied and well produced that they&#8217;ve never been deleted from my offline libraries. Was hoping that would happen again with &#8216;Tribe&#8217; and based on the fact I&#8217;ve listened to the whole thing like 5 times since it came out I think they did it again. Solid album.Â
