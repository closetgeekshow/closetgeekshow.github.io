  <div>
  <p>This whole story is insane: the accusations of slander, the crowd funding campaign by the dev to hire a lawyer, the $10 million figure. all of it. I know devs and reviewers have a complicated relationship and youtubers are often more harsh on bad indie games than they need to be, but to then turn around and sue the guy for an outrageous sum when you can't even get a lawyer is over the top. I didn't buy The Slaughtering Ground because of Sterling's review, I didn't buy it because it looked awful and i hadn't heard a single redeeming thing about it.&nbsp;</p><p>I play bad games if there's something interesting to explore in it, but from what I heard that wasn't the case with The Slaughtering Grounds it's just bad, but that's not Sterling's fault and he should be sued for pointing out the obvious.</p></div>

    This whole story is insane: the accusations of slander, the crowd funding campaign by the dev to hire a lawyer, the $10 million figure. all of it. I know devs and reviewers have a complicated relationship and youtubers are often more harsh on bad indie games than they need to be, but to then turn around and sue the guy for an outrageous sum when you can&#8217;t even get a lawyer is over the top. I didn&#8217;t buy The Slaughtering Ground because of Sterling&#8217;s review, I didn&#8217;t buy it because it looked awful and i hadn&#8217;t heard a single redeeming thing about it.Â

    I play bad games if there&#8217;s something interesting to explore in it, but from what I heard that wasn&#8217;t the case with The Slaughtering Grounds it&#8217;s just bad, but that&#8217;s not Sterling&#8217;s fault and he should be sued for pointing out the obvious.
