This is The Anger Core&#8230;and it needs venting.

This is a podcast where we get together and discuss the stupid stuffÂ that&#8217;s been going on in the world. News, politics, world affairs, and anything else that crosses the newsfeed and aggregators. This is an unfiltered bit of fun where we are looking more to entertain rather than inform. Join us, starting March 20 (or 21st, depending on when we get the episode posted).
