    This is a bit of a long rant.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8220;for the last 14 years, every time MaxMind’s database has been queried about the location of an IP address in the United States it can’t identify, it has spit out the default location of a spot two hours away from the geographic center of the country&#8221;
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    For years residents at a particular property have been harrassed and threatened all because a company doesn&#8217;t actually understand how their tech works.

    <p>
      &#8220;To my knowledge, we have never claimed that our database could be used to locate a household.&#8221;

    This is what the co-founder of MaxMind has to say about it, basically they blame their own for not using it right, not take responsibility for allowing it to be used as such. Not just by a one-off use case, this is how newbies think computers work.

    Well it&#8217;s being fixed now, but I&#8217;m growing tired of ill-thought through technologies adversely affecting normal people with consequence for the person implementing the technology poorly. There&#8217;s little reason to do anything the right way it seems. Cheaper to do a shit job and then fix it 14 years after the fact if complainers get too much press about it.
