  <blockquote><p>"Here are some examples of the arguments: The gold shirts worn by Starfleet officers can't be &nbsp;copyrightable because they fall under the "useful article" doctrine.

The "Starship Enterprise" is too short a phrase to be protected. The Federation logo is adapted from the United Nations flag. Transporters have existed in science fiction since 1877, warp drive since 1945, phasers since H.G.
