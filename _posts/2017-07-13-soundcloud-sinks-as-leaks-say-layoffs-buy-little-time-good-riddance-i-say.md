      The moment that SoundCloud decided that they weren&#8217;t a hosting company for musicians is the moment they lost me. Taking down DJ mixes, taking down bootleg remixes, all of that anti-user behaviour lead to their downfall, I think. They should have served their community of paying users. Instead they tried to join in with everyone else to serve advertisements. Good riddance SoundCloud. You had a nice embedded player but everything about you left a bad taste in my mouth.

        &#8220;SoundCloud holds one of the most differentiated products in streaming music thanks to its repository of user-created songs uploaded by amateur and semi-professional musicians. [&#8230;] At the same time, this content comes with copyright problems and SoundCloud has had trouble monetizing it.&#8221;
