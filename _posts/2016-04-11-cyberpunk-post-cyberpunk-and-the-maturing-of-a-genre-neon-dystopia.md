  <p>"Cyberpunk evolved out of previous works of not just science fiction, but also the works of Beat Poets like William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac, and the Noir movement, from authors like Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Post-Cyberpunk too evolved out of what came before it, as part of a continuum."</p><p>This might explain how Ken and I are such good friends. I'm not even joking. If we are both heavily influenced by related genres/mediums how could we have done anything else&nbsp;but connect?</p></div>
