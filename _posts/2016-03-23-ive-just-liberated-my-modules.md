    An interesting situation in the world of open source.  A developer has removed all of his modules from the NPM system because NPM removed a module without his permission due to a letter from a lawyer. As a result, a number of modules that rely on his modules as dependancies stopped working. Leaving many other developers that relied on his work in a panic because suddenly their code stopped working with no explanation.

    While I feel bad for the other developers, I support Azer Koçulu&#8217;s move as quoted above, he got into open source to help people and if NPM has decided that they would rather be swayed by corporate interests then they don&#8217;t deserve to host his work.
