Goofing around with my friend Ines. She wanted to know how a podcast works so I figured I&#8217;d show her that it&#8217;s just a normal conversation. This is that conversation but it&#8217;s far from normal. 

  * conspiracy theories
  * how the culture you&#8217;re born with and the culture you immerse yourself in changes who you are
  * Brent&#8217;s favorite crazy theory is Terence McKenna&#8217;s <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence\_McKenna#.22Stoned\_ape.22\_theory\_of\_human\_evolution"> Stoned Ape Theory</a>
  * food noises because I know people love that, almonds and dates like a real Bosnian!
  * Brent wants to go camping with Scarborough Dude and Sally
  * Brent harasses Janis The Cat but Ines comes to his defense
  * My love/hate relationship with <a href= "http://eatatgeorgethegreek.com/">George The Greek</a> on Lakeshore Road in Etobicoke
  * reality show contest strategy
  * Ines talks about her upcoming trip to Jamaica 
  * Brent explains why he started listening to music so late
  * Ines talks about her public speaking course
  * Brent is proud to be bougie af
