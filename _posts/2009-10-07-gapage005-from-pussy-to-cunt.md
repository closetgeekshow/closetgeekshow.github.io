Ken talks about his podcasting network  
Brent remembers that Switched On Show, what used to be one of his favorite shows till it ended, is back.  
Ken, FYI: this is Gtalk  
The Mediawacks project is still alive, weâ€™re just lazy  
Is pain (other peopleâ€™s that is) hilarious?  
It is a bit of a dark age lately  
People hundreds of years ago were as smart as us but lacked the base of knowledge we do, Brentâ€™s been thinking about this lately (but forgot to mention that the graphic novel Crecy put the idea in his head)  
Nuit Blanche isnâ€™t much for art, but itâ€™s is nice to play in the city. Ken thinks itâ€™s a very Toronto thing to do.  
Donâ€™t be our friend, we will give away all your secrets ðŸ™‚  
Brent talks tumbl  
3 of Brentâ€™s favorite blogs: Waxy.org Links, Not Always Right, and grinding.be
